## Safety and Functional Requirements for TransFuser

Considering the capability of the simulator, we use the following six safety and functional requirements: 

| Requirement | Fitness Function | Threshold | Explanation
| -------------  | ------------- | -------------- | --------------
| (`r1`) follow the center of the lane  | 1 - (distance(center_of_lane, center_of_ego_vehicle) / 1.15) | 0 | If the ego vehicle deviates from the center of the lane more than 1.15m, it is a safety violation.
| (`r2`) avoid collision with other vehicles  | distance(ego_vehicle, vehicle_in_front) | 0 | If the distance between two vehicles is zero, it is a safety violation. We use length of scenario as maximum possible distance for normalisation
| (`r3`) avoid collision with pedestrians  | distance(ego_vehicle, nearest_pedestrian) | 0 | If the distance between the ego vehicle and its nearest pedestrian is zero, it is a safety violation. We use length of scenario as maximum possible distance for normalisation
| (`r4`) avoid collision with static obstacles | distance(ego_vehicle, nearest_static_object) | 0 | If the distance between the ego vehicle and its nearest static object is zero, it is a safety violation. We use length of scenario as maximum possible distance for normalisation
| (`r5`) reach the destination within a given time | distance_travelled / total_distance | 0.95 | The percentage of travelled distance should be more than 95%.
| (`r6`) abide by traffic rules (e.g., traffic lights) | 1 if all traffic rules are abided by; 0 otherwise | 0 | If any of the traffic rules art not properly abided by, it is a safety violation.

* Each fitness function returns a score ranging between 0 and 1.
* If the fitness score is less than or equal to the threshold, it represents a safety violation.
* The threshold value of 0.95 for `r5` is because we found that the ego vehicle can stop in front of the destination point even if it drives without any issue.

## Constraints in Scenario Generation

The following constraints are considered to avoid trivial violations of the requirements resulting from the VIF and pedestrian:
- We stop the scenario if the EV (Ego Vehicle) passes the VIF to avoid cases where the VIF collides with the EV from the side or from behind;
- We stop the movement of pedestrians if they are out of range of the EV to avoid cases where the pedestrians collides with the EV from the side or from behind;
- We stop the scenario if the direction of the VIF is towards the EV.

The constraints are implemented in `transfuser/leaderboard/leaderboard/scenarios/scenario_manager.py`.

## Environments
We should specify an initial environment that determines the static elements and the initial states of the dynamic elements for simulation. In practice, one can randomize the initial environments to test diverse scenarios. In our evaluation, however, we need the same initial environments for different approaches (and their repeated runs) to compare them fairly in terms of test effectiveness and efficiency. Since the road type defined in the initial environment is one of the critical factors that has the greatest influence on the driving performance of a DADS, we consider three different initial environments having three different road types: *Straight*, *Left-Turn*, and *Right-Turn*.
